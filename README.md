The Emojify Project is Lesson 3 of Udacity's Advanced Android learning path.  The overarching purpose of this project is to exemplify the usefulness and importance of incorporating external libraries into projects.  The Emojify Project uses an Android facial recognition API - Mobile Vision - which includes features to identify faces, determine the location of landmarks (mouth, nose, eyes) and detect the probability of certain states of these landmarks (e.g., are the eye(s) open or closed, is the mouth smiling or frowning).

What Emojify does is to match a face or series of faces with the emoji(s) that most closely resemble the appearance of the face(s).  

This initial commit contains the starter code and comments that will be built upon.
